Description
===========

`PyAX-12`_ is an open source lightweight Python library to control
`Dynamixel AX-12+`_ actuators.

|Watch a demo on youtube|_

Note:

    This project is still in beta stage, so the API is not finalized yet.


Dependencies
============

-  Python >= 3.0
-  `Python-serial`_

PyAX-12 is tested to work with Python 3.4 under Gnu/Linux (Debian 8), MacOSX
(Mavericks 10.9) and Windows (7).
Any Python 3.X version under recent Gnu/Linux, MaxOSX and Windows systems
should suit too.

PyAX-12 can also be run on `Raspberry Pi`_ through the GPIO connector.

`Python-serial`_ is the only dependency required to install PyAX-12.

Note:

    If you use ``pip`` to install PyAX-12, Python-serial will be automatically
    downloaded and installed (see the following install_ section).

Hardware setup
==============

There are several ways to link AX-12 actuators to a computer.
Three different configurations are described here.

For mor information, check the `official AX-12 documentation <https://web.archive.org/web/20101008170532/http://support.robotis.com/en/product/dynamixel/ax_series/dxl_ax_actuator.htm>`__ (archive).

Connecting AX-12 actuators to a computer (including Raspberry Pi computers) through USB port
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The USB2Dynamixel_ can be used to connect AX-12 actuators to your computer.
Actually, any FTDI serial/USB converter device should do the job.

For more information on USB2Dynamixel setup, check the
`official documentation <http://support.robotis.com/en/product/auxdevice/interface/usb2dxl_manual.htm>`__.

Connecting AX-12 actuators to a Raspberry Pi through GPIO port
--------------------------------------------------------------

A small electronic circuit is needed to convert Raspberry Pi UART signals (on
RX and TX pins) to the half-duplex ones required by Dynamixels (see
`this archive <https://web.archive.org/web/20100414173935/support.robotis.com/en/product/dynamixel/dxl_ax_main.htm>`__).

The chips that converts full-duplex into half-duplex are either 74HC126/74HC04
or 74LS241.

Control Dynamixel AX-12 with the 74LS241
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Here are the schematics of the electronic circuit required to control Dynamixel
AX-12 with the 74LS241.

Control Dynamixel AX-12 with the 774HC126/74HC04
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

UART configuration
''''''''''''''''''

Increasing the bandwidth up to 1Mbps may require a special setup (not tested
yet):

- http://www.oppedijk.com/robotics/control-dynamixel-with-raspberrypi
- http://fw.hardijzer.nl/?p=138

Otherwise keeping the bandwidth to 57600bps should work out of the box
(make sure you use the right Dynamixel ID and the Dynamixel bandwidth
is properly setup to 56700bps).

Documentation
=============

.. PyAX-12 documentation is available on the following page:
.. 
..     http://pyax-12.rtfd.org/

- Online Documentation: http://pyax-12.readthedocs.org
- API Documentation: http://pyax-12.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html


Example usage
=============

.. Please check whether the serial port, the baud rate and the
.. Dynamixel IDs defined in the following examples fits with your hardware.

In the following examples, the ``dynamixel_id``, ``port`` and ``baudrate``
values should be adapted depending on your configuration:

- for **Linux** users:
  
  - the ``port`` value should be something like
  
    - "/dev/ttyS0", "/dev/ttyS1", ... if you use an actual serial port
    - "/dev/ttyUSB0", "/dev/ttyUSB1", ... if you use an `USB to serial` adapter
      (like the USB2Dynamixel_ adapter)

  - the ``baudrate`` value should be the same than the one configured in
    Dynamixel units

- for **Windows** users:

  - the ``port`` value should be something like "COM2", "COM3", ... (see the
    *COM port* configuration in the Windows `device manager`_)
  - the ``baudrate`` value should be the same than the one configured in
    the Dynamixel units *and* the Windows `device manager`_ (i.e. check the
    *COM port* configuration in the Windows `device manager`_)

- for **MacOSX** users:
  
  - the ``port`` value should be something like "/dev/tty.usbserial-XXX" if you
    use an `USB to serial` adapter like the USB2Dynamixel_ adapter
  - the ``baudrate`` value should be the same than the one configured in
    Dynamixel units

- for **Raspberry Pi** users:

  - if you want to control AX-12 actuators through GPIO connector, don't forget
    to set ``rpi_gpio`` to ``True`` in the ``Connection`` constructor (check
    the first following example)
  - the ``port`` value should be "/dev/ttyAMA0"

If you use the USB2Dynamixel_ device, make sure its switch is set on "TTL".

Some other examples are available in the examples_ directory.

Ping a Dynamixel
----------------

This snippet prints ``True`` if the specified Dynamixel unit is connected and
available at the given `baudrate`; otherwise it prints ``False``.

::

    from pyax12.connection import Connection

    # Connect to the serial port
    serial_connection = Connection(port="/dev/ttyUSB0", baudrate=57600)

    dynamixel_id = 3

    # Ping the third dynamixel unit
    is_available = serial_connection.ping(dynamixel_id)

    print(is_available)

    # Close the serial connection
    serial_connection.close()


Raspberry Pi users who connected AX-12 actuators to the GPIO connector should
use the following code instead::

    from pyax12.connection import Connection

    # Connect to the serial port
    serial_connection = Connection(port="/dev/ttyAMA0", rpi_gpio=True)

    dynamixel_id = 3

    # Ping the third dynamixel unit
    is_available = serial_connection.ping(dynamixel_id)

    print(is_available)

    # Close the serial connection
    serial_connection.close()


Scan (search available Dynamixel units)
---------------------------------------

This snippet prints the ID list of connected and available Dynamixel units (at
the given `baudrate`).

::

    from pyax12.connection import Connection

    # Connect to the serial port
    serial_connection = Connection(port="/dev/ttyUSB0", baudrate=57600)

    # Ping the dynamixel unit(s)
    ids_available = serial_connection.scan()

    for dynamixel_id in ids_available:
        print(dynamixel_id)

    # Close the serial connection
    serial_connection.close()


Print the control table of the first Dynamixel unit
---------------------------------------------------

This snippet prints the control table of the specified Dynamixel unit (i.e. the
internal state information of the Dynamixel unit).

::

    from pyax12.connection import Connection

    # Connect to the serial port
    serial_connection = Connection(port="/dev/ttyUSB0", baudrate=57600)

    dynamixel_id = 1

    # Print the control table of the specified Dynamixel unit
    serial_connection.pretty_print_control_table(dynamixel_id)

    # Close the serial connection
    serial_connection.close()

Move the first Dynamixel unit to various position angles
--------------------------------------------------------

This snippet moves the first Dynamixel unit to 0°, then -45°, -90°, -135°,
-150° (the maximum CW angle), +150° (the maximum CCW angle), +135°, +90°, +45°
and finally goes back to 0°.

::

    from pyax12.connection import Connection
    import time

    # Connect to the serial port
    serial_connection = Connection(port="/dev/ttyUSB0", baudrate=57600)

    dynamixel_id = 1

    # Go to 0°
    serial_connection.goto(dynamixel_id, 0, speed=512, degrees=True)
    time.sleep(1)    # Wait 1 second

    # Go to -45° (45° CW)
    serial_connection.goto(dynamixel_id, -45, speed=512, degrees=True)
    time.sleep(1)    # Wait 1 second

    # Go to -90° (90° CW)
    serial_connection.goto(dynamixel_id, -90, speed=512, degrees=True)
    time.sleep(1)    # Wait 1 second

    # Go to -135° (135° CW)
    serial_connection.goto(dynamixel_id, -135, speed=512, degrees=True)
    time.sleep(1)    # Wait 1 second

    # Go to -150° (150° CW)
    serial_connection.goto(dynamixel_id, -150, speed=512, degrees=True)
    time.sleep(1)    # Wait 1 second

    # Go to +150° (150° CCW)
    serial_connection.goto(dynamixel_id, 150, speed=512, degrees=True)
    time.sleep(2)    # Wait 2 seconds

    # Go to +135° (135° CCW)
    serial_connection.goto(dynamixel_id, 135, speed=512, degrees=True)
    time.sleep(1)    # Wait 1 second

    # Go to +90° (90° CCW)
    serial_connection.goto(dynamixel_id, 90, speed=512, degrees=True)
    time.sleep(1)    # Wait 1 second

    # Go to +45° (45° CCW)
    serial_connection.goto(dynamixel_id, 45, speed=512, degrees=True)
    time.sleep(1)    # Wait 1 second

    # Go back to 0°
    serial_connection.goto(dynamixel_id, 0, speed=512, degrees=True)

    # Close the serial connection
    serial_connection.close()
